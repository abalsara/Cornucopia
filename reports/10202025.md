## Progress & Issues

### Frontend
**Progress**
- Developed `donate.tsx`, the donation homepage for donors  
- Developed donation information static page  
- Planned usage of React Native Paper components for UI  
- Added React Native Paper package and color schemes based on wireframes  
- Refactored auth pages according to wireframe  

**Issues**
- Leaving certain things unfinished when needed, such as the search function for cities near the user.  

---

### Backend
**Progress**
- Created a database function to add a row to the `public.profiles` table whenever a user is added to the `auth.users` table  
- Added Supabase database table types and query types  
- Added RLS policies to the `profiles` and `charities` tables  
- Implemented form validation functions for auth pages and added test cases  

---

### Design
**Progress**
- Completed donor wireframes  
- Added wireframe annotations & developer notes for implementation  
- Created user flow diagrams documenting navigation between screens for specific tasks/use-cases  
- Created documentation for App Data (describing standardized categories used throughout the app for charities, needs, and donations)  
- Created design rationale documentation (explaining problems encountered, solutions considered, final solution, and rationale)  
- Updated weekly design schedule in our Living Document to include more detail: Wireframes, React Prototypes, User Testing, etc.  

**Issues**
- Completing donor wireframes, user flows, and documentation was more time-consuming than expected, delaying charity admin screens.  

---

## Next Week’s Plans & Goals

### Frontend
- Build out React components for all Donor Screen wireframes.  

### Backend
- Implement and test server-side functions to handle inserting and deleting rows from the Donation and Request database tables while handling row-level security.  

### Design
- Complete Charity Admin wireframes, annotations, developer notes, and user flows  
  - Use Cases (1 day)  
  - Wireframe Screens (3 days)  
  - User Flows (1 day)  
  - Annotations & Developer Notes (1 day)  
- Update design documentation (1 day):  
  - App Data (standardized categories for charities, needs, and donations)  
  - Design Rationale (problems encountered, solutions considered, final solution, rationale)

## Progress & Issues (Individual)

### Andras
**Progress**
- Implemented donation screen placeholder without data for the cities supported or populated by actual charities  
- Added static `donationInfo` page to show users how to use the app to donate  

**Issues**
- Pivoted from designing and implementing the home page this week, since other areas required attention.  

---

### Azita
**Progress**
- Completed all work listed in the design section above (sole designer)  
- Updated Living Document based on TA feedback from Milestone 3  
- Planned & scheduled team meetings  

---

### Charles
**Progress**
- Created a database function to add a row to `public.profiles` when a user is added to `auth.users`  
- Added Supabase table types and query types  
- Added RLS policies to `profiles` and `charities` tables  
- Added React Native Paper package and color schemes  
- Refactored auth pages according to wireframe  
- Implemented form validation functions and added test cases  

**Issues**
- Handling complex business logic securely within SQL database functions is challenging due to limited familiarity. Edge functions may be a better alternative.  

---

### Eli
**Progress**
- Implemented placeholder profile screen (data not yet hooked up)  
- Implemented CI through GitHub Actions:  
  - Automatic linting, Prettier, and type checking  
  - Expo-specific compliance checks  

---

### Spencer
**Progress**
- Expanded database schema to handle `RequestPosts` from charities and individual requests within posts  
- Added Donations tied to users to track donated items, amounts, and timestamps  
- Added charity creation functionality and upserting into respective tables  

---

## Next Week’s Plans & Goals (Individual)

### Andras
- Implement data connection to frontend once backend integration is operational  
- Continue adding pages on the donation tab (e.g., search bar component)  

### Azita
- Complete all items listed in the Design section for next week (sole designer)  
- Spend time understanding the codebase & software architecture  
- Meet with Spencer on **Tuesday, 10/21**, to walk through the codebase  
- Learn to prototype with React Native Paper  
- Continue administrative work: team meetings, assignment reminders, and document updates  

### Charles
- Implement and test server-side functions (possibly Edge functions) to handle inserting and deleting rows from Donation and Request database tables  

### Eli
- Continue building donor screens  
- Work with backend team to build hooks and connect data to frontend  

### Spencer
- Build out SQL queries for gathering data for frontend display  
- Handle user read/write access securely with proper table and row-level permissions  
- Research and potentially implement Edge functions in Supabase with Charles to act as a serverless backend
