# Week 2 Status Report

## Team Report

### Last Week’s Goals
*(Empty for First Week)*

---

### Progress & Issues

#### Frontend
- Added basic auth screen that includes text inputs for email and password as well as sign-in and sign-up buttons  
- Added basic bottom tabs navigation layout  

#### Backend
- Basic auth through Supabase completed  
- Auth synced to profile database for storage  

**Issues:**
- Working with new tools has a steep learning curve, making everything take longer than expected  

#### Design
- Conducted user interviews with donors and charity staff  
- Analyzed results to identify key screens and pain points  
- Started initial wireframes  

**Challenges in designing initial wireframes:**
- Determining a clear tab structure that effectively serves both donors and charity admins  
- Figuring out how to structure the underlying data to support app functionality  
- Difficult to solidify design decisions without direct user input

### Next Week’s Plans & Goals

#### Frontend
- Design specification for home screen in collaboration with the team  
- Implement home screen  
- Unit test home screen  
- Decide on & document app structure and database schema in collaboration with backend  
- Complete the first iteration of wireframes for both donor and charity screens  
  - Donor Screens  
  - Charity Admin Screens  
- Document key user flow decisions for frontend implementation  

#### Backend
- Ensure proper data storage and authorization upon user signup (1 day)  
- Expand table schema as architecture is better understood for needs (N/A)  
- Create logs for user signin/account change requests (2 days)  
- Work with wireframes to get proper functionality setup for each potential user action (5 days)  

#### Design
- Determine app tabs and data schema in collaboration with backend team (2 days)  
- Complete first iteration of wireframes (4 days)  
  - Wireframes for donor screens (2 days)  
  - Wireframes for charity admin screens (2 days)  
- Document key user flow decisions for frontend implementation (1 day)  
- Internal usability testing with the wireframes *(if time allows)*

## Individual Contributions

### Last Week’s Goals
*(Empty for First Week)*

---

### Progress & Issues

#### Andras
- Worked through practice React workflows and scenarios to prepare for implementation  
- Read over implementation of login screen to understand how information is distributed and stored  

#### Azita
- Conducted user interviews with 3 donors *(Angela, Tamara, Melanie)* and 3 charity staff *(Kate, Dong, Brooke)*  
- Analyzed interview results to identify user pain points, needs, and preferences  
- Began initial wireframes for donor screens  

**Challenges:**
- Balancing needs and expectations of both donors and charity staff  
- Deciding which screens or flows are essential for the first wireframe iteration  
- Limited time to analyze interview results before beginning wireframes  
- Without enough external validation, design decisions rely heavily on assumptions  
- Figuring out how to structure the underlying data to support app functionality  

#### Charles
- Created Expo project and added Expo/EAS configuration files and libraries  
- Created Supabase project and added `createClient` function  
- Added a basic Auth screen that allows a user to sign up or log in with email and password  
- Added and configured Husky git hook manager to run test suite, Prettier formatter, and linter on pre-commit  
- Wrote documentation on how to create development builds on iOS *(simulator/physical device)* and Android  

#### Eli
- Began implementing framework for different pages based on design documents  
- Created documents for issue management, scoping, and prioritization  
- Set up Linear to match those guidelines  

#### Spencer
- Created database connection to initial login + profile updates through Supabase  
- Created `profile` and `charity` tables within database to log and store information  

**Challenges:**
- Many new tools to learn and get used to  
- Figuring out schema shape that will best fulfill our needs
