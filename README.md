## Project Description

Cornucopia is a mobile application that streamlines donations by allowing charities to post real-time needs and enabling donors to browse and filter those needs. By centralizing communication, Cornucopia reduces logistical barriers while increasing donor confidence that their contributions are received and appreciated.
