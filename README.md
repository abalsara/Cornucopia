## Project Description

Charity organizations often face urgent needs for goods including food, clothing, and hygiene products. Many community members are eager to donate but lack visibility into what is needed most. As a result, many potential donors donâ€™t follow through, since they lack clear, up-to-date information about what charities truly need.

Cornucopia is a mobile application that streamlines donations by allowing charities to post real-time needs and enabling donors to browse and filter those needs. By centralizing communication, Cornucopia reduces logistical barriers while increasing donor confidence that their contributions are received and appreciated.
