## Project Description

Homeless shelters often face urgent, unpredictable shortages of supplies, while donors lack visibility into what is most needed, leading to mismatched or wasted donations. ShelterLink is a mobile app that solves this by letting shelters post real-time requests and donors list items they can give, with the system automatically matching supply and demand. By centralizing communication, ShelterLink makes donating easier, faster, and more impactful, addressing the critical needs of overwhelmed Seattle shelters.
